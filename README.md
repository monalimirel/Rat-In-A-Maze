# Rat-In-A-Maze
CIS 256 Term Project - Rat-in-a-Maze

@authors Monali Chuatico, Darren Jian

Gather all the files (Direction.java, DisjointSets.java, Main.java, Maze.java, Queue.java, Room.java, SearchPath.java, SearchResult.java, Stack.java, SList.java, SListNode.java, maze.txt) and put them in the same directory.
On terminal, change the directory to where your maze files are located.
For example, if my files are on my Desktop, I would type “cd Desktop” then compile your java file by typing “javac Main.java” then execute the program by typing “java Main” 

The program will prompt the user whether he wishes to open a maze file or create a new maze.
If he wishes to open a maze, maze.txt will be read in and the program will solve the maze.
If he wishes to create a new maze, the program will prompt the user to enter a size for the maze and the program will generate and solve the new maze.
